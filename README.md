# Project Name
CreditCardInterviewChallenge


## ðŸ“˜ Description

This project analyzes customer credit card usage behavior using unsupervised machine learning techniques. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes features such as balance history, purchase types, cash advances, credit limit utilization, and payment patterns.

The objective is to uncover meaningful customer segments using clustering algorithms such as K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering. By analyzing these behavioral and risk-based clusters, we identify key patterns that can inform strategic business decisions â€” including targeted marketing campaigns and proactive risk management.

The analysis includes:

Data cleaning, scaling, and feature engineering

Clustering algorithm selection and validation using Silhouette scores

Business-focused interpretation of customer segments

Visualizations to communicate insights effectively
